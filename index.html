            <h2>RiemannDescartes - a comprehensive guide to AP Calculus AB</h2>
            <h4>Ever look for that education resource that is clean and ad free? Guess what? We got you covered! 
                At reimanndescartes we blend clean layout, innovative explanations, and easy navigation 
                to provide you with the best AP Calculus AB support ever.
                <br><br>
                Each unit begins with theoretical explanations divided by key topics and important formulas, 
                coupled with practice problems sprinkled all over the chapter.
                Our goal is to provide a comprehensive summary of calculus topics and redirect students to additional resources that will be beneficial in their private practice.
                <br>Our website carries an incredibly strong emphasis on "practice, <i>practice, <u>practice</u></i>" - this is crucial!
                <br><br>Overall, I alongside two friends are working to put together a comprehensive tool for mastering calculus concepts.
                <br>Do you want to be a part of this process too? <br>Consider contributing to our GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/riemanndescartes/riemanndescartes.github.io">https://github.com/riemanndescartes/riemanndescartes.github.io</a>

            <h4>
                ~ This program allows the user to apply 4 different filters to an image, altering them at the pixel level, and then creates a warhol showcasing the final result of these filters
                (the warhol takea a few seconds to show up so make sure to wait for it!)
                <br>~ To see the final result, apply all 4 filters, then respond with "none", and you will see the warhol of the 4 images
                <br>~ One limitation of this program is that all four filters need to be applied before the warhol can be displayed.
                <br>~ Another limitation is that each filter can only be applied once.
                <br>~ The original image can easily be changed, so these filters can be applied on any image!

            <h4>
                There's always that one school assignment where you don't push yourself to exceed expectations. But guess what? Your friend's got you covered.
                In Civics class, we had a mock election unit. My group served as a democratic candidate and lost in the mock primaries. We were not overly focused on the media, and that caused our pitfall in the primaries.
                <br>My friend, although from a different class, decided to go above and beyond in his group project. His group represented a worker union and tasked me with making a mock website for his assignemnt.
                <br>
                <br>This website is the product of the content he shared with me and my coding and design choices.
